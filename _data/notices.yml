#            Galaxy Europe will continue to operate over the holiday season although with reduced support capacity. This period will run from 24th December 2021 until the 4th of January 2022.
#            During this time:
#            - No new tools or reference data will be installed
#            - No requests for disk space will be completed
#            - No support tickets will be responded to
#            - No TIaaS requests will be evaluated
#
#            We will also have limited service administration capacity and while we will make all reasonable efforts to keep the service running, there may be issues outside of our control during this period.
#
#            The Galaxy Europe team wish all of our users a safe, relaxing and happy holiday season.

#           Tomorrow, February 25th, we need to perform urgent maintenance to our main storage. We don't expect a major issue except for 
#           jobs that need to access data older than 10 weeks ago. For these, it's possible to get a "no data" answer or a timeout. 
#           Everything should return to normal operation by the end of the day.
